There are two completely new subroutines: newcrg and ect1.
Both of these are found in the gradient.f file.
Subroutine newcrg calculates the instantaneous charge based on 
an atom's base charge and the water molecule's hydrogen bonding pattern. 
The newcrg subroutine is called before empole1. 
(empole1 contains the induced dipole calculation, permanent electrostatic, 
and polarization energy.) 
Subroutine ect1 calculates the charge transfer energy $U_{CT}$ 
and force due to CT including $ \partial E_{CT} / \partial r_{i \alpha} $
and $( \partial E_{m.p.} / \partial q_{j \beta} )( \partial q_{j \beta} / \partial r_{i \alpha}  ) $.
These components of the CT force are added to dem (the force due to permanent multipoles).
The ect1 subroutine is called after empole1. 

The calculation of $( \partial E_{m.p.} / \partial q_{j \beta} )$, 
called dedci(i) in the code, required the modification 
of the empole1d subroutine and associated particle mesh ewald (PME) subroutines.
When empole1d begins, it is given the instantaneous charges. 
The induced dipoles are calculated based on the instantaneous charges. 
Then, the electrostatic and polarization energy is calculated in three parts: 
emrecip1, ereal1d, and the self term calculated within empole1d.
For the real space and self terms, dedci is derived straightforwardly 
from the equation for energy e. 

The energy in reciprocal space is calculated as a function of fphi.
The derivative dfphidciX(k,j,i) is the derivative of fphi with respect to charge
at multipole level k at site j due to change of charge on i.
Because we're using PME, 
the potential fphi is calculated from the charge on the grid, qgrid. 
Within emrecip1, the convolution of qgrid is performed simultaneously
with the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
Therefore, the same fftfront and fftback routines must be performed on dqgrdci(1,i,j,k,isite).
which is the change in qgrid(1,i,j,k) due to a change in charge of isite.
Because the fftfront and fftback routines are set up for the qgrid array with four dimensions,
dqgrdci(1,i,j,k,isite) is copied to qgrid(1,i,j,k) for each isite,
and the FT is performed on that array, then copied back to dqgrdci(1,i,j,k,isite).
(The FT is performed on qgrid(1,i,j,k) first, which is copied to tmpqgrid(1,i,j,k) before working on dqgrdci(1,i,j,k,isite).)
Note: this could be a real bottleneck point for the code but could be amenable to OMP. 

There is a contribution from depdci because of the interaction of the 
induced dipoles with the permanent field. 
The depdci term has contributions in emrecip1 and ereal1d.

The calculation of dqgrdci and dfphidciX are done in the pmestuff.f file. 
In grid\_mpole, dqgrdci are calculated.
A new subroutine, fphi\_mpoleCT, was implemented in pmestuff.f
to calculate dfphidciX from dqgrdci. 


Other modifications include: \\
1. field.f : initialize use\_crgtr to false   \\
2. prmkey.f : change use\_crgtr to true if dct keyword found in parameter file \\
3. readprm.f : read in CT parameters if dct keyword found in parameter file \\
4. potent.f : declare logical use\_crgtr variable \\
5. mpole.f : declaration of dedci and rpole0 \\
6. kmpole.f : allocation of dedci \\
7. kmulti.f : declaration of CT parameters \\
8. gradient.f : calls to newcrg and ect1 subroutines \\
9. 



Generally, for (de)allocation of derivatives with respect to change in charge 
is done at the same time as the variable it is taking the derivative of.
For example, the variable fphi has a derivative fphidciX, 
both of which are declared and allocated in emrecip1. 


New CT code within old routines is marked with the logical variable use\_crgtr
or with DCT in the comments. 


Some routines have additional use statements for access to CT variables. 


Caveats: \\
1. only in empole1d, so only for PME, using mpole-list \\
	many analysis tools may not work \\
2. only tested with beeman integrator \\
3. water only (no ions, no other molecules) \\
4. \\
